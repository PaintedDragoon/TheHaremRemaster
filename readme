So far, Magic path is done.
Remote path will be Soon(TM)

---
The branches are as follows:
Master- The main one, that will be posted when updating
OG new and Beta new, both for new content for harem. OG will be managed by Amne, due to being the original author.
Then there's the Grammarfix branch, for fixing grammar and other things.

I really hope that we can make something worthwhile out of this
